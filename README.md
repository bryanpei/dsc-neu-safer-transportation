# SafePath
A new Flutter application.

## Run the app
To run the app, there are two ways.
- Download the [apk file](https://github.com/bryanpei/safepath/releases/download/alpha-0.01/safeway-alpha-0.01.apk) in the [release](https://github.com/bryanpei/safepath/releases) and install it on an Android phone or emulator. (*Recommended*)
- Install [flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) on your laptap, clone the repo and then run 'flutter fun' in your command line in the repo folder to build the source file. You'll also need an andriod phone or emulater. It'll be easier opening the source file in Andriod studio and build it.
